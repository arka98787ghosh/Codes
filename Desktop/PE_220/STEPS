I have used brute force to compute the position of the cursor after 15258789 steps in D24. Since it 
is inconvenient to calculate after D25 so the rest of my code just reduces computation on the part 
of computer by manipulating the result obtained till these many steps(15258789).15258789=(5^12-1)/2^4;
I observed that the cursor will always be at the same position in any other Di after the same no. 
of steps.

I had observed that if after N steps in any Di the cursor is at (a,b) then after 2N steps in same or
any other Di it will be at the position (a+b,b-a).

so to go to 5^12-1 steps I need to do (a+b,b-a) 4 times on the previous result.

To compensate for the 1 step I had seen that after executing several steps the cursor always points 
downwards. so a forward step downwards is a y=y-1;
 
Then we have position after 5^12 steps say(p,q), form here we need position after 10^12 steps which 
is  5^12*2^12; i.e all we need to do is (p+q,q-p) 12 times to get the position after 10^12 steps. 



find position after 15258789 steps in D24.
do (a+b,b-a) 4 times (adding 4 0s or multiplying by 4 2s)
go 1 step backwards i.e. subtract 1 from the y coordinate of the above result
do (a+b,b-a) 12 times.
