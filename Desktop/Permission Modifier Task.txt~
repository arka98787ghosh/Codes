First of all change modifiers for all(user,group,others) as a-rwx chmod a-rwx /blahblah/
then change the ownership to root using sudo chown root /blahblah/
then change the ownership to root using sudo chgrp root /blahblah/
It is necessary to first change the modifiers as once you change the ownership to root you
are no longer allowed to change the modifiers.
