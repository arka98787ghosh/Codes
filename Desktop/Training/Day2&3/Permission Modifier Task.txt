First of all change modifiers for all(user,group,others) as a-rwx chmod a-rwx /blahblah/
then change the ownership to root using sudo chown root /blahblah/
then change the ownership to root using sudo chgrp root /blahblah/
It is better to first change the modifiers as once you change the ownership to root you
are no longer allowed to change the modifiers or use sudo chmod to do it after changing ownership.
